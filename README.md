# COMPSCI 590V Final Project

This is our final project for UMass Amherst's COMPSCI 590V Data Visualization and Analysis class.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You would need the following items to run the preprocessing script:

```
Python 3
```

and the following Python packages:

```
numpy==1.16.2
pandas==0.24.2
python-dateutil==2.8.0
pytz==2018.9
six==1.12.0
xlrd==1.2.0
```

The rest of the project can be run with a regular internet browser, assuming the project is hosted on any HTTP server from the root of the directory, and then navigating to <`IP`>/index.html.

### Virtual Enviornment

If you would like to use a virtual environment, we suggest `virtualenv`:

```console
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv -p python3 --no-site-packages .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r utils/requirements.txt
```

This will start a virtual python3 enviornment and install all the necessary packages.

### Installing

You can simply download the entirety of our repository and everything will be installed.
